    <h2>Question 1</h2>
    <h4>The purpose of the program is to help users with the decision of what game to get. The functionality is the dropdown menus in which the user can select certain information from, which then contributes to the game that is recommended to them. There is also a text input for their name, which serves as a small greeting when the sentence recommending the game is shown. The inputs of the app include dropdown menus and a text input, which updates the variables required to give a recommendation and correct output. Another input is the buttons pressed to request the result, the output being the updated screen that shows the recommendation in the text box.</h4>
    <h2>Question 2</h2>
    <h4>While I tried out Tristan's app, I got the recommendation of adding more choices to my app. It changed the functionality because there were now more options (budget-wise and genre-wise) for the user to choose from, which meant more output choices and a wider variety of games. I think it improved my app by adding more options and outcomes, which therefore adds to the purpose. It makes the app better serve its purpose with fewer limitations, adding more game recommendations for the user to be able to receive.</h4>
